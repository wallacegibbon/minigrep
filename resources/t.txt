Now that we’ve finished refactoring the configuration parsing,
let’s turn to the program’s logic.
As we stated in “Separation of Concerns for Binary Projects”,
we’ll extract a function named run that will hold all the logic currently
in the main function that isn’t involved with setting up configuration or
handling errors.
When we’re done, main will be concise and easy to verify by inspection,
and we’ll be able to write tests for all the other logic.
